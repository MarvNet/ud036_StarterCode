# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

You only need to run the fresh_tomatoes.py file, there are no more requirements.
I have coded a entertainment_center.py file, but you can use your own, but I've added more arguments to the class, so I recommend to use my entertainment_center.py file.

Thank you!
